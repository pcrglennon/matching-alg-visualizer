Matching Algorithms Research Code
=================

Somewhat poorly organized, but the src folder contains the algorithms code and models code, along with the now not-very-helpful visualizer.

The test folder contains redundant copies of the algorithms/models, along with specific java files to run all algorithms on the different models.  Compile and run one of these files (like TestCampusOne.java) to run the test, and see the results in the test/results folder.

Executing Ant Run will start up the visualizer.
